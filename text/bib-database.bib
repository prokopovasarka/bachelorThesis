However, the main purpose of color perception is not to determine the properties of incident light, but to aid the visual perception of objects and materials in our environment. We review the state of the art on object colors, color constancy, and color categories to gain insight into the functional aspects of color perception. The common ground between these areas of research is that color appearance is tightly linked to the identification of objects and materials and the communication across observers. In conclusion, we argue that research should focus on how color processing is adapted to the surface properties of objects in the natural environment in order to bridge the gap between the known early stages of color perception and the subjective appearance of color.",

Here we review evidence that this otherwise puzzling body of phenomenology is generated by an empirical strategy of perception in which the color an observer sees is entirely determined by the probability distribution of the possible sources of the stimulus. The rationale for this strategy in color vision, as in other visual perceptual domains, is the inherent ambiguity of the real-world origins of any spectral stimulus.}

abstract = {Abstract A remarkable amount of perceptual development occurs in the first year after birth. In this article, we spotlight the case of color perception. We outline how within just 6 months, infants go from very limited detection of color as newborns to a more sophisticated perception of color that enables them to make sense of objects and the world around them. We summarize the evidence that by 6 months, infants can perceive the dimensions of color and categorize it, and have at least rudimentary mechanisms to keep color perceptually constant despite variation in illumination. In addition, infants’ sensitivity to color relates to statistical regularities of color in natural scenes. We illustrate the contribution of these findings to understanding the development of perceptual skills such as discrimination, categorization, and constancy. We also discuss the relevance of the findings for broader questions about perceptual development and identify directions for research.},

abstract="With the intensified competition, attracting and retaining the customers has become a top concern for businesses. Color has been identified as one of most significant factors influencing consumers' purchasing behavior. The purpose of the research is to explore the ways color perceptions influence consumer behavior. A better understanding of influence of color perceptions enables them to direct marketing strategies design and implementation. In the research, the researcher makes an attempt to review relevant research papers and account for why color is important in capturing the interest of consumers. In the paper, consumer behaviors, influential factors and influence of colors on consumer behavior, color meanings and roles are reviewed and critically discussed. It is expected that the study can help better understand consumers' color perceptions and their potential influence on consumer behavior. The color psychology has become growingly significant in producing and packaging products. Colors, thus, accomplished prominence in marketing activities. The findings in the established literature can offer some great implications for businesses in terms of how to leverage color for creating distinct customer experience. The established literature also highlights colors have different meanings in different culture. That indicates the importance of considering cultural difference when exploring influence of color perceptions on consumer behaviors. The paper simply reviews the established literature, and these established findings remain to be empirically tested.",

abstract = {Color blindness is a highly prevalent vision impairment that inhibits people's ability to understand colors. Although classified as a mild disability, color blindness has important effects on the daily activity of people, preventing them from performing their tasks in the most natural and effective ways. In order to address this issue we developed Chroma, a wearable augmented-reality system based on Google Glass that allows users to see a filtered image of the current scene in real-time. Chroma automatically adapts the scene-view based on the type of color blindness, and features dedicated algorithms for color saliency. Based on interviews with 23 people with color blindness we implemented four modes to help colorblind individuals distinguish colors they usually can't see. Although Glass still has important limitations, initial tests of Chroma in the lab show that colorblind individuals using Chroma can improve their color recognition in a variety of real-world activities. The deployment of Chroma on a wearable augmented-reality device makes it an effective digital aid with the potential to augment everyday activities, effectively providing access to different color dimensions for colorblind people.},
